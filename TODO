- Support LF and LFCR line ends
  (needs fgets() alternative).

- remove -n input mode,
  add its functionality (column aliasing) to -a mode,
  have "-n" option as legacy alias for "-U -a" (with coldef requirement)

- fix line limit (-l) in -b mode.
  For example, -l1 fails if the first record does not fit in the first line.
  Same problem might exist with -s as well.
  This means that -l and -s should work with the _record_ counter, not the line counter.
