- Support LF and LFCR line ends
  (needs fgets() alternative).

- remove -n input mode,
  add its functionality (column aliasing) to -a mode,
  have "-n" option as legacy alias for "-U -a" (with coldef requirement)

- -q none

- extract header line:
     "head -n1 input.csv" or "csv -Cil1 <input.csv",
     but -Ci is not allowed (yet). Maybe a new --header-only option?

- -fPIE
